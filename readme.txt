1. DCGAN model jupyter notebook
Assignment 1 code with its last running result, including 500 epoch training record and the visualization diagrams for important metrics.

2. samples folder
Dataset extracted from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/markkostantine/captcha-recognition-using-tensorflow-cnn).
They are labeled by their filenames, so that can support conditional GANs (not practice).

3. checkpoints folder
Store the checkpoints and the final result (epoch 500 relative) model. The sample images are also generated for monitor process and assessment.
Owing to the limitation of upload file size, only limited model file are reserved (epoch 50, 100, 450 and 500)
